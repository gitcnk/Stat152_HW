1. **[3pt]** What is the most surprizing aspect of the Central Limit Theorem?

2. **[3pt]** In building confidence intervals, why do we prefer "2 Standard Deviation" intervals?  Why not 1SD?
Why not 3SD?

3. **[9pt]** Go to pg 312 in our texbook.  Answer question # 6.1, only do parts(a), (b), and (c).  When providing explanations please attach graphical evidence to support your answer for each case.

4. **[6pt]** Go to pg 313 in our texbook. Read the very first sentence in the problem description of question 6.5.  Ignore the rest.  No need to do the rest of the question, instead  construct a 95% confidence interval for the **TRUE proportion**.  Before you do, breifly describe what the **TRUE proportion** (parameter of interest) is in this context.  Make sure you check the most crucial assumption related to this interval and attach graphical evidence to justify the that assumpttion.

5. **[6pt]** Go to pg 313 in our texbook. Read the first two sentence in the problem description of question 6.6.  Ignore the rest.  No need to do the rest of the question, instead construct a 95% confidence interval for the **TRUE proportion**.  Before you do, breifly describe what the **TRUE proportion** (parameter of interest) is in this context. As before, make sure you check the most crucial assumption related to this interval and attach graphical evidence to justify the that assumpttion.


**NOTE:** When doing histograms realted to CLT, please use ``geom_histogram(bins = 100)``, this will prevent spikes in your plots.
